                <p>Like most outdoor sports, rafting, in general, has become safer over the years. Expertise in the sport has increased, and equipment has 
                    become more specialized and improved in quality. As a result, the difficulty rating of most river runs has changed. 
                    A classic example is the Colorado River in the Grand Canyon, which historically had a reputation far exceeding its actual safety statistics. 
                    Today the Grand Canyon sees hundreds of safe rafting trips by both do it yourself rafters and commercial river concessionaires.</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Whitewater rafting, referred to old timers as “River Running”,  is an exhilarating outdoor sport that combines the thrill of navigating through rapid river streams in an inflatable raft, guided by a skilled and experienced leader. 
                The term "whitewater" refers to the frothy, fast-moving water that forms as the river flows over obstacles like rocks and drops in elevation. These rapids are classified by difficulty from Class I (easy) to Class V (extremely difficult), providing options for all skill levels. 
                whitewater rafting has grown from humble beginnings to become a popular pursuit among adventure enthusiasts worldwide.
                Every summer, thousands of people go whitewater rafting on the Kern River, spending multiple days and nights camping along the way. Even more participate in day trips or half-day adventures whenever possible.</p>
            <img src="images/rafting43.jpg" alt="raftinghistory">
            <p>The origins of whitewater rafting trace back to the mid-19th century when rubber rafts were first used by military expeditions to navigate uncharted waters. However, it wasn't until the 1970s that it became popular as a recreational sport. Since then, whitewater rafting has evolved with advancements in safety and equipment, making it accessible to a broader audience.
                Over the years, white water rafting has adapted to environmental concerns, safety advancements, and changing demographics, making it accessible to all skill levels. The sport’s emphasis on eco-friendly practices, education, and continuous development solidified its place in the realm of outdoor adventures.</p>
