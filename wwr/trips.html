                <h2>South Fork American River Rafting Gorge 1-Day</h2>
                <p>
                    This full-day adventure down the lower 13-mile stretch of the South Fork American River offers some of the most exciting Class II & III whitewater in the state and is perfect for beginners, families, staff outings, and anyone who wants a day out paddling in the California sunshine. The trip begins with several miles of bouncy, stress-free rapids before things get a little spicier in the Gorge with big waves, challenging chutes, drops, and unforgettable rapids like Satan’s Cesspool and Hospital Bar. <br>
                    <br>Whether you’re new to rafting and just want to “get your feet wet,” or you only have time for a quick getaway, our 1-day South Fork American River rafting trip will surely be a perfect choice. About an hour from Sacramento, and just an hour and a half from Lake Tahoe, rafting the South Fork of the American River is a quick and relatively easy option for an exciting family or group adventure. Splashy good times are guaranteed.

                <h2>Cataract Canyon Whitewater Rafting</h2>
                <p>
                    Rafting in Utah on the Colorado River through Cataract Canyon has it all: breathtaking scenery, tranquil floating, and one action-packed day of Class III-IV whitewater rafting. Add to that hiking in Canyonlands among multi-million-year-old rock formations, plus nights spent stargazing in an International Dark Sky Park, and you have a whitewater rafting adventure suitable for the whole gang. <br>
                    <br> Our classic 6-day Cataract Canyon rafting trip spends several days leisurely floating through the peaceful waters of Meander Canyon to the confluence of the Green River, allowing plenty of time for quiet reflection from the rafts, or inflatable kayaking and stand-up paddleboarding, before tackling the famous rapids of Cataract Canyon further downstream. For those short on time, the 4-day “express” trip covers the same stretch of the Colorado, but the first half of the adventure is largely motorized to 
                    cover additional miles in the scenic flatwater stretches.

                <h2>Hidden Morocco rafting</h2>
                <p>
                    Morocco is the perfect destination for a very relaxed, week-long, family-friendly rafting holiday. Set in the magnificent Middle Atlas mountain range, the Ahansel river flows down from the peaks and runs deep through a dramatic river gorge. Rafting in this scenery you’ll feel like you are starring in a movie.<br> <br>The beauty of this river trip, is that all the family can enjoy the experience and have a real adventure together in this remote, intoxicating location. It is the perfect antidote to those winter blues with warm weather and stunning scenery. 
                    Explore the mystical city of Marrakech, get lost in the souqs and marvel at the snake charmers. Morocco will delight you in so many ways.
